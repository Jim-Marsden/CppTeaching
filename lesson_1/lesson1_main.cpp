// Hello, this lesson will be on values, and variables

     * Alright, lets look at that line. auto means automatic type deduction, and there's going to be more on types in
     * the next lesson, so we can skip that.
     *
     * my_number is a variable. Think of them as a container for values. Typically, you can change the stored value, but
     * not always.
     *
     * and values are the raw data, like "strings", 'c'hars, and numbers. They're just plain old data. You cannot assign
     * to a value, only variables.
